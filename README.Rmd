# resampleR

**resamplerR** is like M.Kuhn`s **rsample**, but all resamples are realised as plain data.table objects.This package aims to be as easy to extend as possible. 

## Installation

You can install dev version of **resampleR** from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("statist-bhfz/resampleR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(resampleR)
dt <- data.table(
    user = rep(1:100, each = 10),
    date = as.POSIXct(rep(seq(1.8*10e8, 1.8*10e8 + 777600, by = 86400), 100),
                      origin = "1960-01-01"),
    target = rnorm(1e3)
)
cv_split_temporal(dt, "target", "user", "date")
```
